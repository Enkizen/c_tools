# c_tools documentation
Library in C to **match the functions/dependancies** I used to have with *Java and ES6*.

### Tasks to complete

## a) Set up a way to speed up creation of library functions and objects without switching language
https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/src/makeheaders.html
Auto making .h from .c.
.h contains all the header (function declarations) for all the executable .a later.

1)Map Function

2)Filter Function

3)Computational methods such as differentiation, integration using numerical methods

Keep things neater
